<h2> Welcome to the puzzle! This is the welcome page! <h2>
<h3> In order to complete this puzzle, you must reach the 10th stage. </h3>
<p> For each stage you need to enter the url as: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jgiller/[password].html <p>

<ul>
    <li>Sometimes there will be a button or clickable something to get to the next page, like this one</li>
    <li>If you need hints, I will give you 3 in total (for the whole pledge class), but you may have to complete a task to get this hint</li>
    <li>This is something you all work on together!</li>
    <li>If you think it is too hard after the hints, I will make it a bit easier</li>
    <li>Also, some "instructions" may lead you astray, keep that in mind</li>
</ul>
